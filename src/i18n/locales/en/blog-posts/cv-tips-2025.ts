Here are 10 essential tips to make your CV stand out in 2025.',

                        content: 'In 2025, digital CVs aren\'t just a nice-to-have, they\'re expected. Recruiters want instant access to your profile, and they want it updated in real-time. A static PDF might work for some applications, but having a digital CV that you can share with a link or QR code shows you\'re tech-savvy and forward-thinking.',
                        why: 'Recruiters spend an average of 6-8 seconds on initial CV screening. A digital CV loads faster, looks better on mobile devices, and can be updated instantly if you realize you forgot something.',
                        action: 'Create your digital CV on platforms like itsmycv.be. Keep it updated with your latest achievements, and use it as your primary professional profile.',

                        content: 'Before a human sees your CV, it likely goes through an Applicant Tracking System. These systems scan for keywords, relevant experience, and proper formatting. If your CV isn\'t ATS-friendly, it might never reach the hiring manager.',
                        why: 'Over 75% of CVs are rejected by ATS before a human ever sees them. The reason? Poor formatting, missing keywords, or incompatible file types.',
                        action: 'Use standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills). Include keywords from the job description naturally throughout your CV. Avoid images, tables, and complex formatting that ATS can\'t read. Digital CV platforms like itsmycv.be are designed to be ATS-compatible by default.',

                        content: 'Don\'t just list what you did, show what you achieved. Modern CVs focus on outcomes and impact, not job descriptions.',
                        why: 'Recruiters want to know what value you\'ll bring to their organization. Impact statements demonstrate your ability to deliver results.',
                        action: 'Transform "Responsible for managing social media accounts" into "Increased social media engagement by 150% and grew followers from 5K to 25K in 12 months." Use numbers, percentages, and specific outcomes whenever possible.',

                        content: 'The days of "one-size-fits-all" CVs are over. In 2025, personalization is key. Tailor your CV to match each specific job application.',
                        why: 'Generic CVs get lost in the pile. Tailored CVs show you\'ve done your research and are genuinely interested in the role.',
                        action: 'Read the job description carefully and identify the top 5 requirements.

                        why: 'Long, rambling CVs lose the reader\'s attention. A focused CV respects the recruiter\'s time and highlights your most relevant qualifications.',
                        action: 'For each experience, include only the most relevant and impressive achievements. If something doesn\'t add value or isn\'t relevant to the role you\'re applying for, cut it. Every word should earn its place.',

                        why: 'Everyone claims to be a "team player" or "excellent communicator." Without evidence, these claims are meaningless. Recruiters want to see demonstrations of these skills in action.',
                        action: 'Instead of listing "Leadership" as a skill, write "Led a cross-functional team of 8 to deliver a €500K project 2 weeks ahead of schedule."

Better yet, use a digital CV platform that\'s automatically optimized for all devices.
